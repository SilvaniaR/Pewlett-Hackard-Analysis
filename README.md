# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis:SQL

## Overview of the analysis:
We conducted an intial analysis and were surprised to see the amount of employees coming into retirement. This prompt us to do further analysis with the data provided to narrow down the employees by departments and titles. We utilized employees IDs, titles, department, birth date and hire date to determine two groups the retiring employees and the employees coming into the mentorship program. Below we can view the results of both groups. 

## Results:

[mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/SilvaniaR/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/8052615/mentorship_eligibility.csv)


## Summary:
PH can now come up with a hiring plan and moving forward be proactive with a mentorship program. At the end of each year an analysis should be conducted to see how many are retering and how many eployees are eliglible for the mentorship program. A query that can help further plan better for the future is a mentorship titles table. This table will output the count of employees by department who are eligble for the program. This data can also be used to match up how many mentors and mentees are for a match up.
